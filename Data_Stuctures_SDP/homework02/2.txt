once upon a time, in a small town, there was a bear that lived near a bell tower. every morning, the bell rang, 
signaling the start of the day. one day, a young boy went to the market to place a bid on some items, but 
he was interrupted by the sight of a bull in the town square. the boy, curious as ever, decided to buy 
some fresh produce. as he walked through the market, he noticed a sell sign on a stall selling rare items, 
including a vintage stock certificate.

later, the boy reached the end of the street and saw a sign that said "do not stop here." 
it was an odd sign, but he paid it no mind as he continued on his way.
