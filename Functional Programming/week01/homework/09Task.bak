#|Description:

A snail crawls up a column. During the day it crawls up some distance. During the night it sleeps,
 so it slides down for some distance (less than it crawls up during the day).

Your function accepts three parameters:

The height of the column (meters);
The distance that the snail crawls during the day (meters);
The distance that the snail slides down during the night (meters).
Calculate the number of days the snail will need to reach the top of the column.

Acceptance criteria:

Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words my test.
All tests pass.|#

(define (snail height up down)
   (define (helper days current-height)
     (if (>= (+ current-height up) height)
         days
         (helper (add1 days) (+ current-height (- up down)))
    ))
  (if (< up down)
      0
      (helper 1 0)))
